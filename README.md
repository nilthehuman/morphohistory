# morphohistory

This is going to be a kind of simulator to account for the dispersion and
vacillation of various inflected word forms in the Hungarian language.

morphohistory is in *pre-alpha* stage. If anything works properly, thank your lucky stars.

This project is MIT Licensed.

## Note on Kivy installation

The morphohistory GUI is built with the Kivy framework, which is not shipped with
Python by default, so you will have to install it. Please run `make init` from
this folder.
