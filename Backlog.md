* Implement Rescorla-Wagner conditioning model as an option
* Implement convolution-based learning model
* Figure out pylint license compatibility issue (GPL vs MIT)
* Duplicate same Confirm/Discard user logic on Tuning tab as on the other tabs?
* Upon double click show the speaker's bias in all paradigm cells
* Show unusual settings on special warning label in the agora's bottom right corner
* Undo/redo stack
* Allow iteration total to be shown as reasonably calculated "elapsed time", more intuitive
* Pressing return/enter in popups should be equivalent to clicking confirm button
* Increase dot size logarithmically to reflect experience (make this optional)
* Use a single global NameTag for all SpeakerDots
* Figure out why startup has become slower (white window lingers a bit longer)
* Multithreading for performance
* If the app is about to be closed without saving, ask the user to save or discard changes
* Use type hints throughout the codebase?
* Keep SpeakerDots inside their AgoraWidget
* Gently snap SpeakerDots to grid when dragging
* Make smoke tests work on both Linux and Windows
* Write smoke tests for saving/loading
* Speaker weight to account for social influence
* Speaker labels to differentiate age cohorts, social groups etc.
* Add GitHub Action to install and run tests after every push
* Bugfix: looks like the progress bar graphic starts out in the negative range or something
* Pimp up the README
* Fix crash when one speaker alone is simulated
* Extend simulation to verb paradigms
* Speakers should be mortal and new ones should be born
* Creative on-line form production: sum of biases in a cell may be less than one, rely on surface analogy with other lexemes to produce "missing" form
